# Arcade-games-py
#
The games are made on Codeskulptor(A browser based python interpretor). http://www.codeskulptor.org/
#

The games are easily portable for PC by just changing the GUI module that I have used to "SimpleGUICS2Pygame.simpleguics2pygame as simplegui".
#
To see the games live in action visit the links in Codeskulptor_links.md file.
