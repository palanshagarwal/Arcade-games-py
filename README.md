The games are made on Codeskulptor(A browser based python interpretor).

The games are easily portable for PC by just changing the GUI module that I have used to "SimpleGUICS2Pygame.simpleguics2pygame as simplegui".

The games can also be ported through pygame module by just changing the syntax of some function calls
